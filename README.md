# nd-tss
n-dimensional travellling salseperson problem solver


* Uses a simulated annealing approach based on this [blog post](https://ericphanson.com/blog/2016/the-traveling-salesman-and-10-lines-of-python/) at ericphanson.com.
* Plots solutions for sets of 1, 2, & 3 dimensional input points.
* Works well for small sets of input points
